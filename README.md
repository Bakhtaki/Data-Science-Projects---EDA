# Data-Science-Projects EDA
 The projects I've done over the course of time for praticing my EDA and Data Science Skills. You can check the code out and also learn!
 
**1. Heart Data Analysis** ➡️ I simply took a dataset from **Kaggle** and did some EDA on it. Rather basic one but was technical, meaning it had some jargon which took me some time to understand. Otherwise a great datset. Enjoyed exploring it!

**2. Flights Prices - Analysis** ➡️ Another dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction), all about flight prices. I did a very comprehensive EDA on it. It was fun as I learned many new plots and explored!!

**3. Salary Dataset - Analysis** ➡️ It was an awsome project, truely loved it. It was regading some salaries of devs in India. It was a small dataset, yet you could do so much! Check it out to see what I did!!

**4. Forbes Richest Poeple - Analysis** ➡️ Ahh, didn't go so well - actually got bored. The project still isn't complete. If you find it interesting, feel free to comeplete the project. I'd love the contibution!!

**5. Netflix TV Shows and Movies - Analysis** ➡️ My favourite most project ever. I did this as a part of Certification by [Jovain](https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas). I learned a lot from it, like A LOT. I used many plots, purely from matplotlib. It was really a decent project, which took me around 3 days to complete but totally worth it!

**6. Tradyflow - Analysis** ➡️ This dataset was obtained from [tradytics.com](https://tradytics.com/trady-flow) on the date **21st June 2022**. It could be possible by the time you get the code, you might not find the dataset on the website **tradytics.com** except for this Github repo.
