# Data-Science-Projects EDA
 The projects I've done over the course of time for praticing my EDA and Data Science Skills. You can check the code out and also learn!
 
**1. Heart Data Analysis** ➡️ I simply took a dataset from **Kaggle** and did some EDA on it. Rather basic one but was technical, meaning it had some jargon which took me some time to understand. Otherwise a great datset. Enjoyed exploring it!
