# Data-Science-Projects EDA
 The projects I've done over the course of time for praticing my EDA and Data Science Skills. You can check the code out and also learn!
 
 1. **First Project:** The Iris Dataset ➡️ In this dataset, I used the very famous dataset out there - the Iris Dataset, containing all the info about 3 unique species of 
 irises. They are 4 columns containg those properties and the the fifth one is the specie name. It's a small, yet a great dataset to do some EDA on and gradualy build
 up your Data Science skills.
